# Logger Package

The logger package provides a simplified composite literal for creating structured loggers, leveraging the `slog` package.

## NewLogger

 This is the primary function in this package. The `NewLogger` function takes an `io.Writer` (optional), and the `LOG_LEVEL` environment varible (optional). It returns a new logger instance from the slog package.

```go
func NewLogger(writer io.Writer, level ...string) (logger *slog.Logger)
```

## Parameters
- `writer`: An io.Writer where the log output will be written. This is optional, and if not provided, the logger will default to writing to os.Stdout.
- `level`: A string (`os.Getenv("LOG_LEVEL")`) which sets the logging level for the logger. This is optional. If not provided, it defaults to the error logging level - `slog.LevelError`.

## Logging Levels
The logging levels used are:

- DEBUG = -4
- INFO = 0
- WARN = 4
- ERROR = 8
- FATAL = 12 (custom log level)

If a message is logged at a level of ERROR+4, it is output as "FATAL" in the log.

## Usage
Use of the logging package should be used at the top level function such as within `main`. Functions which return errors should remain

To create a logger with default parameters (writing to `os.Stdout` at ERROR level and above):
```go
log := logger.NewLogger(nil, os.Getenv("LOG_LEVEL"))
...

// Debugging
var1, var2, var3, err := exampleFunction()
log.Debug("exampleFunction has run", "var1", var1, "var2", var2, "var3", var3)

// Information
_, err := exampleFunction()
log.Info("exampleFunction has run")

// Warning
diskSpace, err := diskSpaceChecker()
if diskSpace >= 80 {
	log.Warn("disk space is over 80%")
}

// Error (default level)
_, err := exampleFunction()
	if err != nil {
		log.Error("describe action here", "rsp", err)
	}

// Fatal
ctx := context.Background()
...
_, err := exampleFunction2()
	if err != nil {
		log.Log(ctx, logger.Fatal, "describe action here", "rsp", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
```
Outputs:
```bash
time=2023-07-20T16:54:40.558+10:00 level=DEBUG msg="exampleFunction has run" var1="something" var2="something" etc.
time=2023-07-20T16:54:40.558+10:00 level=INFO msg="exampleFunction has run"
time=2023-07-20T16:54:40.558+10:00 level=WARN msg="disk space is over 80%"
time=2023-07-20T16:54:40.558+10:00 level=ERROR msg="describe action here" rsp="error: something in exampleFunction went wrong"
time=2023-07-20T16:54:40.558+10:00 level=FATAL msg="describe action here" rsp="error: something in exampleFunction2 went very wrong"
exit status 1
```

To create a logger writing to a provided `io.Writer` at the ERROR level (this is mainly for testing the output stream):
```go
buf := new(bytes.Buffer)
logger := NewLogger(buf)
```
